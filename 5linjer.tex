We propose a mathematical framework to connect cell metabolism to a physiologically based whole-body model. We are able to write a large metabolic network with a few compact differential equations, that contain stoichiometry and reaction kinetics.

We will present a model, with the objective to quantitatively describe carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism. The known pathways connecting the three macronutrients results in a model consisting of 7 compartment, 16 metabolites and 2 hormones, with enzymatic reactions described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
